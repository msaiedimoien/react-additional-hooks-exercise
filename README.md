## ðŸš€ Learning and using React hooks

### Getting to know useRef hook

When to Use Refs

1. Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.
2. Triggering imperative animations.
3. Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.\
   `Avoid using refs for anything that can be done declaratively.`

NOTE:\
`useRef` is very similar to `State`, with the difference that
when you change the value of the useRef.current,
it is not re-rendered

### Getting to know useMemo hook

`useMemo` will only recompute the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed.\
This optimization helps to avoid expensive calculations on every render.

NOTE:\
Donâ€™t do anything there that you wouldnâ€™t normally do while rendering.\
For example, side effects belong in `useEffect`, not `useMemo`.
